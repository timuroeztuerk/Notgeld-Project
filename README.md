In order to replicate from scratch, follow the steps below:

1- Run the wurttemberg-with-names-generate.r to create the shapefile for our purposes.
2- Run the reichsbank-locations-generate.py to create the locations data for reichsbank.
3- Run the reichsbank-distances-generate.py to create the distances data for reichsbank.

Then the data is ready to be used in the visualization, which is as a jupyter notebook called Visualizations.ipynb.
